<h1> The Rules of Chess: A Quick Guide to How to Play Chess </h1>
<p>
		-  Chess uses six pieces, each of which moves in a specific way. <br></br>
		-  All pieces share some common traits. <br></br>
		-  No piece is allowed to land on a square occupied by a friendly piece.<br></br>
		-  If a piece lands on a square occupied by an enemy piece, that enemy is captured and removed from the board. <br></br>
		-  With the exception of the knight, pieces are not allowed to jump over other pieces. <br></br>

	<h1> Pieces </h1>
	<div class="p1">
<p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/illustrated-guide-to-chess-pieces-611547">rook</a> usually looks like a small tower. It moves in a straight line horizontally or vertically for any number of squares.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/illustrated-guide-to-chess-pieces-611547">bishop</a> moves in a straight line diagonally for any number of squares.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/illustrated-guide-to-chess-pieces-611547">queen</a>, the most powerful piece in chess, can move any number of squares in a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</li>
			
<li>The <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/illustrated-guide-to-chess-pieces-611547">king</a>, can also move in any direction, including diagonally, but it can only move one square at a time.</li> 
			
<li>The <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/illustrated-guide-to-chess-pieces-611547">knight</a>, which usually looks like a horse, moves in an irregular, L-shaped pattern. From the center of the board, the knight can move to eight different squares. 
Though the knight can leap over other pieces, it doesn't capture pieces it jumps over; it only captures a piece on a  square it lands on.</li>
			 
<li><a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/illustrated-guide-to-chess-pieces-611547">Pawns</a>are the shortest and weakest pieces in chess. Pawns are also the only pieces that move one way, but capture in another fashion. 
Unlike other pieces, pawns can only move forward, not backward. A pawn can only move directly forward one square at a time unless it is still on the square on which it began the game; if it is the pawn's first move, it can move one or two squares directly forward.</li>
		</ul>

	<h1> Winning </h1>
	<div class="p1">
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>When a player's king is under attack and threatened with capture, you say that the king is in <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/check-checkmate-and-stalemate-611546">check.</a></li>
		<li>When in check, that player must take action to avoid having his king captured by moving the king, 
		     capturing the attacking piece, or -- except in the case of a knight check -- blocking the attack.</li>
		<li>You win the game via checkmate, where you attack your opponent's king in such a way that he cannot avoid being captured.</li>
		<li>The game can end in a draw, where there is no winner. The most common way to draw a game is by <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/check-checkmate-and-stalemate-611546">stalemate.</a>.</li>
